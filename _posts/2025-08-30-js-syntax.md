The main diferences between `let` and `var` lie in scope, variable hoisting, redeclaration, and global object binding.

## 01 scope

The scope of `var` is function-level, while the scope of `let` is block-level.

- `var`: Function scope. When declared inside a function, it's only accessible within that function; outside, it becomes a global variable.
- `let`: Block scope. When declared inside `{}`, it's only accessible within that block.

```js
if(true) {
  var a = 10
  let b = 20
}

console.log(a) // 10
console.log(b) // ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

## 02 Hoisting

- `var`: Declarations are hoisted to the top of scope and initlized as `undefined`.
- `let`: Also hoisted, but kept in "temporal dead zone(TDZ)". It will cause an error if accessed beforehand.

```js
console.log(a);
var a = 10; // undefined

console.log(b);
let b = 20; // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
```

## 03 Redeclaration

- `var`: Allows redeclaration within the same scope without any errors;
- `let`: Does not allow redeclaration within the same scope.

```js
var a = 1;
var a = 2;  // OK

let b = 1;
let b = 2; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared
```

## 04 Global Object Binding

- `var`: When declared in the global scope, it attaches to the global object(`window` in broswers)
- `let`: Does not atttach to the global object.

```js
var a = 10;
console.log(window.a) // 10

let b = 20;
console.log(window.b) // undefined
```
