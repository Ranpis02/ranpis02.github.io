## Why?

If we installed Spotify via Scoop, its automatic updates could cause the program to crash. Therefore, we need to take measures to prevent the Spotify from updating automatically.

## Method

1. open windows powershell(need admin priviledge)
2. hit commands as follows:

   ```shell
   # remove the `Update` directory in `appdata/local/spotify`
   del %localappdata%\Spotify\Update

   # recreate `Update` directory 
   mkdir %localappdata%\Spotify\Update

   # `icacls`: a command used to modify file and folder permissions
   # D(delete), R(read)
   icacls %localappdata%\Spotify\Update /deny "%username%":D

   icacls %localappdata%\Spotify\Update /deny "%username%":R
   ```
